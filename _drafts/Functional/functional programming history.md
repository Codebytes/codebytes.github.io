## History of FP

A bit of History....

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1 July 1646 â€“ 14 November 1716)
He developed differential and integral calculus independently of Isaac Newton.  He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators.
He dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements. He realized that the first step would have to be a clean formal language, and much of his subsequent work was directed towards that goal. 
He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of virtually all digital computers.
