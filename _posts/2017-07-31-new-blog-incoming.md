# Welcome

My name is Chris Ayers.  I'm a Principal Consultant at [Cardinal Solutions](https://www.cardinalsolutions.com) in Tampa, Fl.

I am a .Net and Angular developer but dabble in a little of everything.  I want to right about some of the cool things I see and learn about in my career.  While I've never been much of a writer, I hope that you read, learn, and enjoy some of the things I post.

More to come...
