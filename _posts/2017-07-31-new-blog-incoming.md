# Welcome

My name is Chris Ayers.  I'm a DevOps Lead at [New Signature](https://www.newsignature.com) in Tampa, Fl.

I do a lot of DevOps, .Net and javascript. I'm dabbling in a little of everything.  I want to write about some of the cool things I see and learn about in my career.  While I've never been much of a writer, I hope that you read, learn, and enjoy some of the things I post.

More to come...
